# Embedded Linux Device Drivers

## Linux Architecture
- Linux is primarily divided into User Space & Kernel Space. These two components interact through a System Call Interface – which is a predefined and matured interface to Linux Kernel for Userspace applications. The below image will give you a basic understanding.

  <img src="https://embetronicx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kernel-space-vs-user-space.png" alt="https://embetronicx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kernel-space-vs-user-space.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

  

  ### Kernel Space

  - Kernel space is where the kernel (i.e., the core of the operating system) executes (i.e., runs) and provides its services.

  ### User Space

  - User Space is where the user applications are executed.

    

  ## Linux Kernel Modules

  - Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. 

  - Custom codes can be added to Linux kernels via two methods.
  
    - The basic way is to add the code to the kernel source tree and recompile the kernel. --> ***In-tree Kernel Module*** 
    - A more efficient way is to do this is by adding code to the kernel while it is running. This process is called loading the module, where the module refers to the code that we want to add to the kernel.  --> ***Out of tree Kernel Module***

  - Since we are loading these codes at runtime and they are not part of the official Linux kernel, these are called **Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM)**.

  - LKMs can perform a variety of task, but basically, they come under three main categories,

    - Device drivers

    - Filesystem drivers

    - System calls

      

  ### LInux Device Drivers

  - A device driver is designed for a specific piece of hardware. The kernel uses it to communicate with that piece of hardware without having to know any details of how the hardware works.

    

  ### File System Drivers

  - A filesystem driver interprets the contents of a filesystem (which is  typically the contents of a disk drive) as files and directories and such. 

  - There are lots of different ways of storing files and directories and such on disk drives, on network servers, and in other ways. For each way, you need a filesystem driver. 

  - For example, there’s a filesystem  driver for the ext2 filesystem type used almost universally on Linux  disk drives. There is one for the MS-DOS filesystem too, and one for  NFS

    

  ### System calls

  - Userspace programs use system calls to get services from the kernel. 

  - For example, there are system calls to read a file, to create a new process, and to shut down the system. 

  - Most system calls are integral to the system and  very standard, so are always built into the base kernel (no LKM option).

    

  ### Advantages of LKM

  - One major advantage they have is that we don’t need to keep rebuilding the  kernel every time we add a new device or if we upgrade an old device.  This saves time and also helps in keeping our base kernel error-free.

  - LKMs are very flexible, in the sense that they can be loaded and unloaded with a single line of command. This helps in saving memory as we load  the LKM only when we need them.

    

  ### Differences Between Kernel Modules and User Programs

  - **Kernel modules have separate address spaces.** A module runs in kernel space. An application runs in userspace. The system software is protected from user programs. Kernel space and user space have their own memory address spaces.

  - **Kernel modules have higher execution privileges.** Code that runs in kernel space has greater privilege than code that runs in userspace.

  - **Kernel modules do not execute sequentially.** A user program typically executes sequentially and performs a single task from beginning to end. A kernel module does not execute sequentially. A kernel module registers itself in order to serve future requests.

  - **Kernel modules use different header files.** Kernel modules require a different set of header files than user programs require.

    

  ### Difference Between Kernel Drivers and Kernel Modules

  - A kernel module is a bit of compiled code that can be inserted into the kernel at run-time, such as with `insmod` or `modprobe`.

  - A driver is a bit of code that runs in the kernel to talk to some hardware device. It “drives” the hardware. Almost every bit of hardware in your computer has an associated driver.

    

  ## Device Driver

  - A device driver is a particular form of software application that is designed to enable interaction with hardware devices. 

  - Without the required device driver, the corresponding hardware device fails to work.

  - A device driver usually communicates with the hardware by means of the communications subsystem or computer bus to which the hardware is  connected. 
  
  - Device drivers are operating system-specific and  hardware-dependent. 
  
  - A device driver acts as a translator between the  hardware device and the programs or operating systems that use it.

    
  
  ### Types

  - Character Driver
  - Block Driver
  - Network Driver
  
  
  
  ***In Linux, everything is a file. It means Linux treats everything as a File even hardware.***
  
  
  
  ### Character Device
  
  - A char file is a hardware file that reads/writes data in character by character fashion. 
  - Some classic examples are keyboard, mouse, serial printer.
  
  ### Block Device
  
  - A block file is a hardware file that reads/writes data in blocks instead of character by character.
  - This type of file is very much useful when we want to write/read data in a bulk fashion. 
  - Examples : HDD, USB, and CDROM's are block devices.
  
  ### Network Device
  
  - A network device is, so far as Linux’s network subsystem is concerned, an entity that sends and receives packets of data. 
  - Examples : Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
  
  ## First Linux Device Driver
  
  ## Module Information
  
  - License
  - Author
  - Module Description
  - Module Version
  
  These pieces of information are present in the **`Linux/module.h`** as macros.
  
  ### License
  
  - GPL, or the GNU General Public License, is an open-source license meant for software
  
  **`"GPL" [GNU Public License v2 or later]`**
  
  **`"GPL v2" [GNU Public License v2]`**
  
  ```c
  MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
  MODULE_LICENSE("GPL v2");
  ```
  
  ### Author
  
  - Using this Macro we can mention that who is writing this Linux device driver or module. 
  
  ```c
  MODULE_AUTHOR("Saishiva Reddy Gatla");
  ```
  
  ## Module Description
  
  - Using this Macro we can give a description of the module or Linux device driver. So **`modinfo`** can show a module description for users wanting to know.
  
  ```c
  MODULE_DESCRIPTION("A sample driver");
  ```
  
  ## Simple Kernel Module Programming
  
  ### Init function
  
  This is the function that will execute first when the Linux device driver is loaded into the kernel. For example, when we load the driver using **`insmod`**, this function will execute. Please see below to know the syntax of this function.
  
  ```c
  static int __init hello_world_init(void) /* Constructor */
  {
      return 0;
  }
  module_init(hello_world_init);
  ```
  
  This function should register itself by using **`module_init()`** macro.
  
  ### Exit function
  
  This is the function that will execute last when the Linux device driver is unloaded from the kernel. For example, when we unload the driver using **`rmmod`**, this function will execute. Please see below to know the syntax of this function.
  
  ```c
  void __exit hello_world_exit(void)
  {
      
  }
  module_exit(hello_world_exit);
  ```
  
  This function should register itself by using **`module_exit()`** macro.
  
  ## Printk()
  
  In C programming, we will print the values using **`printf()`** function. **`printf()`** is a user-space function. So we cant use this here. So, they have created another function for the kernel which is **`printk().`**
  
  One of the differences is that **`printk `** lets you classify messages according to their severity by associating different log levels, or priorities, with the messages. You usually  indicate the log level with a macro. There are several macros used for **`printk`**.
  
  **KERN_EMERG:**
  
  Used for emergency messages, usually those that precede a crash.
  
  **KERN_ALERT:**
  
  A situation requiring immediate action.
  
  **KERN_CRIT:**
  
  Critical conditions, often related to serious hardware or software failures.
  
  **KERN_ERR:**
  
  Used to report error conditions; device drivers often use `KERN_ERR` to report hardware difficulties.
  
  **KERN_WARNING:**
  
  Warnings about problematic situations that do not, in themselves, create serious problems with the system.
  
  **KERN_NOTICE:**
  
  Situations that are normal, but still worthy of note. A number of security-related conditions are reported at this level.
  
  **KERN_INFO:**
  
  Informational messages. Many drivers print information about the hardware they find at startup time at this level.
  
  **KERN_DEBUG:**
  
  Used for debugging messages.
  
  **Example**
  
  ```c
  printk(KERN_INFO "Hello World!");
  ```
  
  ## The difference between printf and printk
  
  - **`Printk() `**is a kernel-level function, which has the ability to print out to  different log levels as defined in. We can see the prints using **`dmesg`** command.
  - **`printf()`**will always print to a file descriptor – STD_OUT. We can see the prints in the STD_OUT console.
  
  Note: In the newer Linux kernels, you can use the APIs below instead of this **`printk`**.
  
  - **`pr_info`** – Print an info-level message. (ex. **`pr_info("test info message\n")`**).
  - **`pr_cont`** – Continues a previous log message in the same line.
  - **`pr_debug`** – Print a debug-level message conditionally.
  - **`pr_err`** – Print an error-level message. (ex. **pr_err(“test error message\n”)**).
  - **`pr_warn`** – Print a warning-level message.
  
  ### Simple Program - Hello World
  
  ```c
  #include <linux/init.h>
  #include <linux/module.h>
  #include <linux/kernel.h>

  static int __init hello_init(void)
  {
      printk(KERN_INFO "\n Hello, World\n");
      return 0;
  }
  
  static void __exit hello_exit(void)
  {
      printk(KERN_INFO"\n Goodbye, World\n");
  }
  
  module_init(hello_init);
  module_exit(hello_exit);
  ```

  ## Cross Compiler & Kernel Environment for rpi4
  
  ### **Steps for cross compiling Kernel :**
  
  - On Host(Ubuntu) :
  
    1. Install Required dependencies :
  
       ```bash
       sudo apt install git bc bison flex libssl-dev make libc6-dev libncurses5-dev
       ```
  
    2. Install 32-bit Toolchain :
  
       ```bash
       sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-armhf
       ```
  
    3. Download / clone Kernel source
  
       ```bash
       mkdir rpi
       cd rpi
       git clone --depth=1 --branch rpi-5.15.y https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux
       cd linux
       ```
  
    4. Apply the config file of rpi4 :
  
       - Check config file for your board(rpi4) using below command.
  
         ```bash
         ls arch/arm/configs
         ```
  
       - Default config file for rpi4 is **bcm2711_defconfig**.
  
       - Now apply config file using below command.
  
         ```bash
         make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- bcm2711_defconfig
         ```
  
    5. Build Kernel image & Kernel modules for rpi4 :
  
       ```bash
       make -j8 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage modules
       ```
  
       - Result of above command :
  
         ```bash
         ls arch/arm/boot
         Zimage  # This is the result.
         ```
  
    6. Plug in your SD Card to your HOST PC(Ubuntu) :
  
       ```bash
       cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /media/<user_name of your PC>/boot
       ```

    9. if **ssh** & "wpa_supplicant.conf" files are not in your boot partition then follow steps-2 of flashing raspbian OS.
  
    10. Plug out your SD Card and insert into your Raspberry pi board.
  
    11. Board will start booting and access it.
  
    
  
  ## Loading and Unloading the Linux Device driver
  
  A Kernel Module is a small file that may be loaded into the running Kernel and unloaded.
  
  ### Loading
  
  To load a Kernel Module, use the **`insmod`** command with root privileges.
  
  For example, our module file name is hello_world_module.ko
  
  ```bash
  sudo insmod hello_world_module.ko
  ```
  
  **`lsmod`** used to see the modules were inserted. 
  
  Use **`dmesg`** to see the kernel prints.
  
  So, when I load the module, it executes the init function.
  
  ### Listing the Modules
  
  In order to see the list of currently loaded modules, use the **`lsmod `**command. 
  
  ### Unloading
  
  To un-load, a Kernel module, use the **`rmmod `**command with root privileges.
  
  ```bash
  sudo rmmod hello_world_module.ko or sudo rmmod hello_world_module
  ```
  
  So, when I unload the module, it executes the exit function.
  
  ### Getting Module Details
  
  In order to get information about a Module (author, supported options), use the **`modinfo`** command.
  
  For example
  
  ```bash
  modinfo hello_world_module.ko
  ```
  
  ## Module Parameters
  
  ### Module Parameters Macros
  
  - **`module_param()`**
  - **`module_param_array()`**
  - **`module_param_cb()`**
  
  ### module_param()
  
  This macro is used to initialize the arguments. **`module_param`** takes three parameters: the name of the variable, its type, and a permissions mask to be used for an accompanying sysfs entry. The macro should be  placed outside of any function and is typically found near the head of  the source file. **`module_param()`** macro, defined in **`linux/moduleparam.h`**.
  
  **`module_param(name, type, perm);`**
  
  module_param() macro creates the sub-directory under **/sys/module**. For example,
  
  ```c
  module_param(value, int, S_IWUSR|S_IRUSR);
  ```
  
  This will create a sysfs entry. (**`/sys/module/hello_world_module/parameters/value`**
  
  

## EXPORT_SYMBOL in Linux Device Driver

### EXPORT_SYMBOL’s role

When some symbols (variables or functions) are using **`EXPORT_SYMBOL`** macro (ex. **`EXPORT_SYMBOL(func_name)`**), those symbols are exposed to all the loadable kernel drivers. You can  call them directly in your kernel module without modifying the kernel  code. In other words, It tells the **`kbuild`** mechanism that the symbol referred to should be part of the global list of kernel symbols. That allows the kernel modules to access them.

Only the symbols that have been explicitly exported can be used by other modules.

Another macro is also available to export the symbols like **`EXPORT_SYMBOL`**. That is **`EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()`**.

**`EXPORT_SYMBOL`** exports the symbol to any loadable module.
**`EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL`** exports the symbol only to GPL-licensed modules.

### How to use EXPORT_SYMBOL?

- Declare and define the symbol (functions or variables) which you want to make  it visible to other kernel modules. Then below the definition, use **`EXPORT_SYMBOL(symbol name)`**. Now it is visible to all loadable modules.
- Now take the kernel driver who is gonna use the above-exported symbol. Declare the symbol using **`extern`**. Then use the symbol directly.
- Finally, load the module first, who has the definition of the export symbol. Then load the caller module using **`insmod`**.

### Limitation

- That symbol should not be **`static`** or **`inline.`**
- Order of loading the driver is matter. ie. We should load the module which  has the definition of the symbol, then only we can load the module that  is using that symbol.

## How Applications will communicate with Hardware devices?

<img src="https://embetronicx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/character-device-driver-communication.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb266" style="zoom: 75%;" />

- Initially, the Application will open the device file. This device file is created by the device driver).
- Then this device file will find the corresponding device driver using major and minor numbers.
- Then that Device driver will talk to the Hardware device.

## Major Number and Minor Number

The Linux kernel represents character and block devices as pairs of numbers **`<major>:<minor>`**.

### Major number

Traditionally, the major number identifies the driver associated with the device. A  major number can also be shared by multiple device drivers. See **`/proc/devices`** to find out how major numbers are assigned on a running Linux instance.

### Minor Number

The major number is to identify the corresponding driver. Many devices may use the same major number. So we need to assign the number to each  device which is using the same major number. So, this is a minor number. In other words, The device driver uses the minor number  **<minor>** to distinguish individual physical or logical devices.

### Allocating Major and Minor Number

We can allocate the major and minor numbers in two ways.

1. Statically allocating
2. Dynamically Allocating

### Statically allocating

```c
int register_chrdev_region(dev_t first, unsigned int count, char *name);
```

- Here, **`first`** is the beginning device number of the range you would like to allocate.

- **`count`** is the total number of contiguous device numbers you are requesting.

- **`name`** is the name of the device that should be associated with this number range; it will appear in **`/proc/devices`** and **`sysfs`**.

The return value from ***`register_chrdev_region`\*** will be 0 if the allocation was successfully performed. In case of  error, a negative error code will be returned, and you will not have  access to the requested region.

```c
MKDEV(int major, int minor);
```

```c
MAJOR(dev_t dev);
MINOR(dev_t dev);
```

Example :

```c
dev_t dev = MKDEV(235, 0);
register_chrdev_region(dev, 1, "My_dev");
```

### Dynamically Allocating

* If we don’t want the fixed major and minor numbers please use this  method. This method will allocate the major number dynamically to your driver which is available.

```c
int alloc_chrdev_region(dev_t *dev, unsigned int firstminor, unsigned int count, char *name);
```

**`dev`** is an output-only parameter that will, on successful completion, hold the first number in your allocated range.

**`firstminor`** should be the requested first minor number to use; it is usually 0.

**`count`** is the total number of contiguous device numbers you are requesting.

**`name`** is the name of the device that should be associated with this number range; it will appear in **`/proc/devices`** and **`sysfs`**.

### Unregister the Major and Minor Number

```c
void unregister_chrdev_region(dev_t first, unsigned int count);
```

## Device File Creation for Character Drivers

## Device Files

- The device file allows transparent communication between user-space applications and hardware.

### Creating Device File

We can create a device file in two ways.

1. Manually
2. Automatically

### Manually Creating Device File

```bash
mknod -m <permissions> <name> <device type> <major> <minor>
```

*<**`name`**>* – your device file name that should have a full path (**`/dev/name`**)

<***`device`****` type`**>* – Put **c** or **b**

c – Character Device

b – Block Device

<***`major`***> – major number of your driver

<***`minor`***> – minor number of your driver

-m <**`permissions`**> *–* optional argument that sets the permission bits of the new device file to *permissions*.

Example:

```c
sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/My_device c 246 0
```

#### Advantages

- Anyone can create the device file using this method.
- You can create the device file even before loading the driver.

### Automatically Creating Device File

1. Include the header file **`linux/device.h`** and **`linux/kdev_t.h`**
2. Create the struct Class
3. Create Device with the class which is created by the above step

#### Create the class

```c
struct class \* class_create (struct module \*owner, const char \*name);
```

***`owner`** –* pointer to the module that is to “own” this struct class

***`name`** –* pointer to a string for the name of this class

**Note,** the pointer created here is to be destroyed when finished by making a call to **`class_destroy`**.

```c
void class_destroy (struct class \* cls);
```

#### Create Device

```c
struct device *device_create (struct *class, struct device *parent, dev_t dev, void * drvdata, const char *fmt, ...);
```

**`class `**		  – pointer to the struct class that this device should be registered to

**`parent`**		– pointer to the parent struct device of this new device, if any

**`devt `**			– the dev_t for the char device to be added

**`drvdata`** 	– the data to be added to the device for callbacks

**`fmt `**		   	– string for the device’s name

**`...`** 			  – variable arguments

**Note,** you can destroy the device using **`device_destroy()`**.

```c
void device_destroy (struct class \* class, dev_t devt);
```

## cdev structure

```c
struct cdev { 
    struct kobject kobj; 
    struct module *owner; 
    const struct file_operations *ops; 
    struct list_head list; 
    dev_t dev; 
    unsigned int count; 
};
```

This is **`cdev`** structure. Here we need to fill the two fields,

1. **`file_operations`** (This we will see after this cdev structure)
2. **`owner`** (This should be **`THIS_MODULE`**)

There are two ways of allocating and initializing one of these structures.

1. Runtime Allocation

```c
struct cdev *my_cdev = cdev_alloc( );
my_cdev->ops = &my_fops;
```

​	2. Own allocation

```c
void cdev_init(struct cdev *cdev, struct file_operations *fops);
```

Once the **`cdev `** structure is set up with file_operations and owner, the final step is to tell the kernel about it with a call to:

```c
int cdev_add(struct cdev *dev, dev_t num, unsigned int count);
```

**`dev `** is the **`cdev`** structure,

**`num `** is the first device number to which this device responds, and

**`count `** is the number of device numbers that should be associated with the device.

To remove a char device from the system, call:

```c
void cdev_del(struct cdev *dev);
```

### File_Operations

The **`file_operations`** structure is how a char driver sets up this connection. The structure, (defined in  *<linux/fs.h>*) is a collection of function pointers. Each open file is associated with its own set of functions. The operations are mostly in charge of  implementing the system calls and are, therefore, named open, read, and so on.

A **`file_operations`** structure is called **`fops`**. Each field in the structure must point to the function in the driver that implements a specific operation or have to left `NULL` for unsupported operations. 

#### read

```c
ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char _ _user *, size_t, loff_t *);
```

#### write

```c
ssize_t (*write) (struct file *, const char _ _user *, size_t, loff_t *);
```

#### ioctl

```c
int (*ioctl) (struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);
```

#### Open

```c
int (*open) (struct inode *, struct file *);
```

#### release (close)

```c
int (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);
```

Example:

```c
static struct file_operations fops =
{
.owner          = THIS_MODULE,
.read           = my_read,
.write          = my_write,
.open           = my_open,
.release        = my_release,
};
```

## Functions used in driver

- kmalloc()
- kfree()
- copy_from_user()
- copy_to_user()

#### kmalloc()

- **`kmalloc`** function is used to allocate the memory in kernel space. This is like a malloc() function in userspace.

```c
#include <linux/slab.h>
void *kmalloc(size_t size, gfp_t flags);
```

**Arguments**

***`size`**–* how many bytes of memory are required.

**`flags`**– the type of memory to allocate.

***GFP = Get Free pages***

The *`flags`* argument may be one of:

**`GFP_USER`** – Allocate memory on behalf of the user. May sleep.

**`GFP_KERNEL`** – Allocate normal kernel ram. May sleep.

**`GFP_ATOMIC`** – Allocation will not sleep. May use emergency pools. For example, use this inside interrupt handler.

**`GFP_HIGHUSER`** – Allocate pages from high memory.

**`GFP_NOIO`** – Do not do any I/O at all while trying to get memory.

**`GFP_NOFS`** – Do not make any fs calls while trying to get memory.

**`GFP_NOWAIT`** – Allocation will not sleep.

**`__GFP_THISNODE`** – Allocate node-local memory only.

**`GFP_DMA`** – Allocation is suitable for DMA. Should only be used for **`kmalloc`** caches. Otherwise, use a slab created with SLAB_DMA.

Also, it is possible to set different flags by OR’ing in one or more of the following additional ***`flags`\***:

**`__GFP_COLD`** – Request cache-cold pages instead of trying to return cache-warm pages.

**`__GFP_HIGH`** – This allocation has high priority and may use emergency pools.

**`__GFP_NOFAIL`** – Indicate that this allocation is in no way allowed to fail (think twice before using).

**`__GFP_NORETRY`** – If memory is not immediately available, then give up at once.

**`__GFP_NOWARN`** – If allocation fails, don’t issue any warnings.

**`__GFP_REPEAT`** – If allocation fails initially, try once more before failing.

### kfree()

This is like a free() function in the userspace. This is used to free the previously allocated memory.

```c
void kfree(const void \*objp)
```

**Arguments** 

**`\*objp `**– pointer returned by kmalloc

### copy_from_user()

- This function is used to Copy a block of data from user space (Copy data from user space to kernel space). 

```c
unsigned long copy_from_user(void \*to, const void __user \*from, unsigned long  n);
```

**Arguments**

**`to`** – Destination address, in the kernel space

**`from`** – The source address in the user space

**`n`** – Number of bytes to copy

**Returns number of bytes that could not be copied. On success, this will be zero.**

### copy_to_user()

- This function is used to Copy a block of data into userspace (Copy data from kernel space to user space).

```c
unsigned long copy_to_user(const void __user \*to, const void \*from, unsigned long  n);
```

**Arguments**

**`to`** – Destination address, in the user space

**`from`** – The source address in the kernel space

**`n`** – Number of bytes to copy

**Returns number of bytes that could not be copied. On success, this will be zero.**

## Open()

This function is called first, whenever we are opening the device file. In this function, I am going to allocate the memory using `kmalloc`. In the userspace application, you can use **`open()`** system call to open the device file.

```c
static int my_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
​        /*Creating Physical memory*/
​        if((kernel_buffer = kmalloc(mem_size , GFP_KERNEL)) == 0){
​            printk(KERN_INFO "Cannot allocate memory in kernel\n");
​            return -1;
​        }
​        printk(KERN_INFO "Device File Opened...!!!\n");
​        return 0;
}
```

## write()

When writing the data to the device file it will call this write function.  Here I will copy the data from user space to kernel space using **`copy_from_user()`** function. In the userspace application, you can use **`write()`** system call to write any data the device file.

```c
static ssize_t my_write(struct file *filp, const char __user *buf, size_t len, loff_t *off)
{
​        copy_from_user(kernel_buffer, buf, len);
​        printk(KERN_INFO "Data Write : Done!\n");
​        return len;
}
```

## read()

When we read the device file it will call this function. In this function, I used **`copy_to_user()`**. This function is used to copy the data to the userspace application. In the userspace application, you can use **read()** system call to read the data from the device file.

```c
static ssize_t my_read(struct file *filp, char __user *buf, size_t len, loff_t *off)
{
​        copy_to_user(buf, kernel_buffer, mem_size);
​        printk(KERN_INFO "Data Read : Done!\n");
​        return mem_size;
}
```

## close()

When we close the device file that will call this function. Here I will free the memory that is allocated by **`kmalloc`** using **`kfree()`**. In the userspace application, you can use **`close()`** system call to close the device file.

```c
static int my_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
​        kfree(kernel_buffer);
​        printk(KERN_INFO "Device File Closed...!!!\n");
​        return 0;
}
```

## IOCTL

IOCTL is referred to as Input and Output Control, which is used to talking to device drivers. This system call, available in most driver categories. The major use of this is in case of handling some specific operations of a device for which the kernel does not have a system call by default.

- Some real-time applications of ioctl are Ejecting the media from a “cd”  drive, change the Baud Rate of Serial port, Adjust the Volume, Reading  or Writing device registers, etc.

#### Steps involved in IOCTL

There are some steps involved to use IOCTL.

- Create IOCTL command in driver
- Write IOCTL function in the driver
- Create IOCTL command in a Userspace application
- Use the IOCTL system call in a Userspace

### Create IOCTL Command in the Driver

To implement a new ioctl command we need to follow the following steps.

1. Define the ioctl command

```c
#define "ioctl name" __IOX("magic number","command number","argument type")
```

where ***`IOX`*** can be :
“**`IO`**“: an ioctl with no parameters
“**`IOW`**“: an ioctl with write parameters (copy_from_user)
“**`IOR`**“: an ioctl with read parameters (copy_to_user)
“**`IOWR`**“: an ioctl with both write and read parameters

- The **`Magic Number`** is a unique number or character that will differentiate our set of  ioctl calls from the other ioctl calls. some times the major number for  the device is used here.
- Command Number is the number that is assigned to the ioctl. This is used to differentiate the commands from one another.
- The last is the type of data.

2. Add the header file **`linux/ioctl.h`** to make use of the above-mentioned calls.

Example:

```c
#include <linux/ioctl.h>

#define WR_VALUE _IOW('a','a',int32_t*)
#define RD_VALUE _IOR('a','b',int32_t*)
```

### Write IOCTL function in the driver

```c
int  ioctl(struct inode *inode,struct file *file,unsigned int cmd,unsigned long arg)
```

Where

<**`inode`**> : is the inode number of the file being worked on.
<**`file`**>   : is the file pointer to the file that was passed by the application.
<**`cmd`**>     : is the ioctl command that was called from the userspace.
<**`arg`**>     : are the arguments passed from the userspace

Within the function “ioctl” we need to implement all the commands that we defined above (**`WR_VALUE`**, **`RD_VALUE`**). We need to use the same commands in the **`switch`** statement which is defined above.

### Create IOCTL command in a Userspace application

```c
#define WR_VALUE _IOW('a','a',int32_t*)
#define RD_VALUE _IOR('a','b',int32_t*)
```

### Use IOCTL system call in Userspace

- Include the header file **`<sys/ioctl.h>`**.Now we need to call the new ioctl command from a user application.

```c
long ioctl( "file descriptor","ioctl command","Arguments");
```

Where,

<**`file descriptor`**>: This is the open file on which the ioctl command needs to be executed, which would generally be device files.
<**`ioctl command`**>	: ioctl command which is implemented to achieve the desired functionality
<**`arguments`**>			: The arguments need to be passed to the ioctl command.

#### **Example**

```c
ioctl(fd, WR_VALUE, (int32_t*) &number); 
ioctl(fd, RD_VALUE, (int32_t*) &value);
```

File operation structure will be

```c
static struct file_operations fops =
{
        .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
        .read           = my_read,
        .write          = my_write,
        .open           = my_open,
        .unlocked_ioctl = my_ioctl,
        .release        = my_release,
};
```



## Waitqueue in Linux

## Introduction

When you write a Linux Driver or Module or Kernel Program, Some processes  should wait or sleep for some event. There are several ways of handling  sleeping and waking up in Linux, each suited to different needs.  Waitqueue also one of the methods to handle that case.

Whenever a process must wait for an event (such as the arrival of data or the  termination of a process), it should go to sleep. Sleeping causes the  process to suspend execution, freeing the processor for other uses.  After some time, the process will be woken up and will continue with its job when the event which we are waiting for has arrived.

Wait queue is a mechanism provided in the kernel to implement the wait. As  the name itself suggests, waitqueue is the list of processes waiting for an event. In other words, A wait queue is used to wait for someone to wake you up when a certain condition is true. They must be used carefully to ensure there is no race condition.

There are 3 important steps in Waitqueue.

1. Initializing Waitqueue
2. Queuing (Put the Task to sleep until the event comes)
3. Waking Up Queued Task

## Initializing Waitqueue

Use this Header file for Waitqueue (**`include <linux/wait.h>`**). There are two ways to initialize the waitqueue.

1. Static method
2. Dynamic method

You can use any one of the methods.

### Static Method

```c
DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(wq);
```

Where the “wq” is the name of the queue on which task will be put to sleep.

### Dynamic Method

```c
wait_queue_head_t wq;
init_waitqueue_head (&wq);
```

## Queuing

Once the wait queue is declared and initialized, a process may use it to go to sleep. There are several macros are available for different uses. 

1. **wait_event**
2. **wait_event_timeout**
3. **wait_event_cmd**
4. **wait_event_interruptible**
5. **wait_event_interruptible_timeout**
6. **wait_event_killable**

Old kernel versions used the functions **`sleep_on()`** and **`interruptible_sleep_on()`**, but those two functions can introduce bad race conditions and should not be used.

Whenever we use the above one of the macro, it will add that task to the waitqueue which is created by us. Then it will wait for the event.

### 1. wait_event

sleep until a condition gets true.

```c
wait_event(wq, condition);

wq – the waitqueue to wait on
condition – a C expression for the event to wait for
```

### 2. wait_event_timeout

sleep until a condition gets true or a timeout elapses

```c
wait_event_timeout(wq, condition, timeout);

wq – the waitqueue to wait on
condtion – a C expression for the event to wait for
timeout – timeout, in jiffies
```

### 3. wait_event_cmd

sleep until a condition gets true

```c
wait_event_cmd(wq, condition, cmd1, cmd2);

wq – the waitqueue to wait on
condtion – a C expression for the event to wait for
cmd1 – the command will be executed before sleep
cmd2 – the command will be executed after sleep
```

### 4. wait_event_interruptible

sleep until a condition gets true

```c
wait_event_interruptible(wq, condition);

wq – the waitqueue to wait on
condtion – a C expression for the event to wait for
```

### 5. wait_event_interruptible_timeout

sleep until a condition gets true or a timeout elapses

```c
wait_event_interruptible_timeout(wq, condition, timeout);

wq– the waitqueue to wait on
condtion – a C expression for the event to wait for
timeout – timeout, in jiffies
```

### 6. wait_event_killable

sleep until a condition gets true

```c
wait_event_killable(wq, condition);

wq – the waitqueue to wait on
condtion– a C expression for the event to wait for
```

## Waking Up Queued Task

When some Tasks are in sleep mode because of the waitqueue, then we can use the below function to wake up those tasks.

1. **wake_up**
2. **wake_up_all**
3. **wake_up_interruptible**
4. **wake_up_sync and `wake_up_interruptible_sync`**

### 1. wake_up

wakes up only one process from the wait queue which is in non-interruptible sleep.

```c
wake_up(&wq);

wq – the waitqueue to wake up
```

### 2. wake_up_all

wakes up all the processes on the wait queue

```c
wake_up_all(&wq);

wq – the waitqueue to wake up
```

### 3 . wake_up_interruptible

wakes up only one process from the wait queue that is in interruptible sleep

```c
wake_up_interruptible(&wq);

wq– the waitqueue to wake up
```

### 4. wake_up_sync and wake_up_interruptible_sync

```c
wake_up_sync(&wq);

wake_up_interruptible_sync(&wq);
```



## Kernel Synchronization

## Race Condition

A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, we don’t know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread  scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are “racing” to access/change  the data.

To avoid race conditions, we have many ways like Semaphore, Spinlock, and Mutex. 

## Mutex

A *mutex* is a mutual exclusion lock. Only one thread can hold the lock.

A mutex can be used to prevent the simultaneous execution of a block of  code by multiple threads that are running in a single or multiple  processes.

Mutex is used as a synchronization primitive in situations where a resource has to be shared by multiple threads simultaneously.

A mutex has ownership. The thread which locks a Mutex must also unlock it.

So whenever you are accessing a shared resource that time first we lock the mutex and then access the shared resource. When we are finished with that shared resource then we unlock the Mutex.

## Mutex in Linux Kernel

Today most major operating systems employ multitasking. Multitasking is where multiple threads can execute in parallel and thereby utilizing the CPU  in an optimum way. Even though, multitasking is useful, if not implemented cautiously can lead to concurrency issues (Race condition), which can be very difficult to handle.

The actual mutex type (minus debugging fields) is quite simple:

```c
struct mutex {
    atomic_t        count;
    spinlock_t      wait_lock;
    struct list_head    wait_list;
};
```

We will be using this structure for Mutex in Linux kernel. Refer to `linux/include/linux/mutex.h`

### Initializing Mutex

We can initialize Mutex in two ways

1. Static Method
2. Dynamic Method

#### Static Method

This method will be useful while using global Mutex. This macro is defined below.

```c
DEFINE_MUTEX(name);
```

This call *defines* and *initializes* a mutex. Refer to **`linux/include/linux/mutex.h`**

#### Dynamic Method

This method will be useful for per-object mutexes when the mutex is just a field in a heap-allocated object. This macro is defined below.

```c
mutex_init(struct mutex \*lock);
```

**Argument:**

**`struct mutex \*lock`** – the mutex to be initialized.

This call *initializes* already allocated mutex. Initialize the mutex to the unlocked state.

It is not allowed to initialize an already locked mutex.

##### Example

```c
struct mutex my_mutex;
mutex_init(&my_mutex);
```

### Mutex Lock

Once a mutex has been initialized, it can be locked by any one of them below.

#### mutex_lock

This is used to lock/acquire the mutex exclusively for the current task. If the mutex is not available, the current task will sleep until it acquires the Mutex.

The mutex must, later on, released by the same task that acquired it.  Recursive locking is not allowed. The task may not exit without first  unlocking the mutex. Also, kernel memory where the mutex resides must  not be freed with the mutex still locked. The mutex must first be  initialized (or statically defined) before it can be locked. **`memset`**-ing the mutex to 0 is not allowed.

```c
void mutex_lock(struct mutex \*lock);
```

**Argument:**

**`struct mutex \*lock`** – the mutex to be acquired

#### mutex_lock_interruptible

Locks the mutex like `mutex_lock`, and returns 0 if the mutex has been acquired or sleep until the mutex  becomes available. If a signal arrives while waiting for the lock then  this function returns `-EINTR`.

```c
int mutex_lock_interruptible(struct mutex \*lock);
```

**Argument:**

**`struct mutex \*lock`** – the mutex to be acquired

#### mutex_trylock

This will try to acquire the mutex, without waiting (will attempt to obtain the lock, but will not sleep). Returns 1 if the mutex has been acquired  successfully, and 0 on contention.

```c
int mutex_trylock(struct mutex \*lock);
```

**Argument:**

**`struct mutex \*lock`** – the mutex to be acquired

This function must not be used in an interrupt context. The mutex must be released by the same task that acquired it.

### Mutex Unlock

This is used to unlock/release a mutex that has been locked by a task previously.

This function must not be used in an interrupt context. Unlocking of a not locked mutex is not allowed.

```c
void mutex_unlock(struct mutex \*lock);
```

**Argument:**

**`struct mutex \*lock`** – the mutex to be released

### Mutex Status

This function is used to check whether mutex has been locked or not.

```c
int mutex_is_locked(struct mutex \*lock);
```

**Argument:**

**`struct mutex \*lock`** – the mutex to check the status.

**Returns** 1 if the mutex is locked, 0 if unlocked.

## Semaphores

Semaphore as used in an operating system to restrict the access to  resources by multiple processes at the same time. When a semaphore is  used to restrict the access to only one process at a time, it is termed  as mutex, as it serves the purpose of mutual exclusion. 
 The part of the program which accesses the shared resource is called as  the critical section. Hence a semaphore restricts the execution of the  critical section by multiple processes at the same time. 

<img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2_7c4Hamjck/Ud_MOPa8FnI/AAAAAAAABJA/UryGG1v6O98/s640/semaphore.gif" style="zoom:50%;" />

Semaphore initialization: 

Dynamic-

 ```c
 struct semaphore name;
 sema_init(&name, count);
 ```

Static-

```c
static DECLARE_MUTEX(name);
```

Various kinds of down() : 

 **down() :** Will keep waiting for the semaphore unless it does not become available. Can not be interrupted. 
 **down_interruptible():** Will keep waiting for the semaphore  unless it does not become available but can be interrupted. This is  always preferable over down(). 
 **down_trylock() :** Will not put the process to sleep if semaphore is already being held, but returns immediately with non zero return value. 

```c
void down(struct semaphore *sem);
void up(struct semaphore *sem);
int  down_interruptible(struct semaphore *sem);
int  down_killable(struct semaphore *sem);
int  down_trylock(struct semaphore *sem);
int  down_timeout(struct semaphore *sem, long jiffies);
```

| API                                            | Work                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| void sema_init(struct semaphore *sem, int val) | Dynamically initialize a Semaphore |
| void down(struct semaphore *sem);              | Acquire a Semaphore                |
| void up(struct semaphore *sem);                | Release a Semaphore                |

## Spinlocks

The `spinlock` is a low-level synchronization mechanism which in simple words, represents a variable which can be in two states:

- `acquired`;
- `released`.

```c
void spin_lock(spinlock_t *lock);
```

Note that all spinlock waits are, by their nature, uninterruptible. Once you call spin_lock, you will spin until the lock becomes available.

To release a lock that you have obtained, pass it to:

```c
void spin_unlock(spinlock_t *lock);
```

| Function            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| spin lock init( )   | Set the spin lock to 1 (unlocked)                            |
| spin lock( )        | Cycle until spin lock becomes 1 (unlocked), then set it to 0 (locked) |
| spin unlock( )      | Set the spin lock to 1 (unlocked)                            |
| spin unlock wait( ) | Wait until the spin lock becomes 1 (unlocked)                |
| spin is locked( )   | Return 0 if the spin lock is set to 1 (unlocked); 0 otherwise |
| spin trylock( )     | Set the spin lock to 0 (locked), and return 1 if the lock is obtained; 0 otherwise |

## Completion

**Completion**, the name itself says. When we want to notify or wake up some thread or  something when we finished some work, then we can use completion.

There are 5 important steps in Completions.

1. Initializing Completion in Linux
2. Re-Initializing Completion in Linux
3. Waiting for completion (The code is waiting and sleeping for something to finish)
4. Waking Up Task (Sending a signal to sleeping part)
5. Check the status

### Initialize Completion

We have to include **`<linux/completion.h>`** and creating a variable of type **`struct completion`,**which has only two fields:

```c
struct completion { 
    unsigned int done; 
    wait_queue_head_t wait; 
};
```

Where, 

**`wait`** is the waitqueue to place tasks on for waiting (if any).

**`done`** is the completion flag for indicating whether it’s completed or not.

We can create the struct variable in two ways.

1. Static Method
2. Dynamic Method

You can use any one of the methods.

#### Static Method

```c
DECLARE_COMPLETION(data_read_done);
```

Where the “**`data_read_done`**” is the name of the struct which is going to create statically.

#### Dynamic Method

```c
init_completion (struct completion \* x);
```

Where, **`x`** – completion structure that is to be initialized.

**Example:**

```c
struct completion data_read_done;
init_completion(&data_read_done);
```

### Re-Initializing Completion

```c
reinit_completion (struct completion \* x);
```

Where, **`x`** – completion structure that is to be reinitialized

Example :

```c
reinit_completion(&data_read_done);
```

### Waiting for completion

For a thread to wait for some concurrent activity to finish, it calls anyone of the function based on the use case.

#### wait_for_completion

This is used to make the function waits for the completion of a task.

```c
void wait_for_completion (struct completion \* x);
```

Where, **`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

This waits to be signaled for completion of a specific task. It is NOT interruptible and there is no timeout.

**Example:**

```c
wait_for_completion (&data_read_done);
```

Note that **`wait_for_completion()`** is calling **`spin_lock_irq()/spin_unlock_irq()`**, so it can only be called safely when you know that interrupts are  enabled. Calling it from IRQs-off atomic contexts will result in  hard-to-detect spurious enabling of interrupts.

#### **wait_for_completion_timeout**

This is used to make the function waits for the completion of a task with a  timeout. Timeouts are preferably calculated with msecs_to_jiffies() or  usecs_to_jiffies(), to make the code largely HZ-invariant.

```c
unsigned long wait_for_completion_timeout (struct completion \* x, unsigned long timeout);
```

where,**`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

**`timeout`** – timeout value in jiffies

This waits for either completion of a specific task to be signaled or for a  specified timeout to expire. The timeout is in jiffies. It is not  interruptible.

It **returns** **0** if timed out, and **positive** (at least 1, or the number of jiffies left till timeout) if completed.

**Example:**

```c
wait_for_completion_timeout (&data_read_done);
```

#### **wait_for_completion_interruptible**

This waits for the completion of a specific task to be signaled. It is interruptible.

```c
int wait_for_completion_interruptible (struct completion \* x);
```

where, **`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

It return **-ERESTARTSYS** if interrupted, **0** if completed.

#### **wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout**

This waits for either completion of a specific task to be signaled or for a  specified timeout to expire. It is interruptible. The timeout is in  jiffies. Timeouts are preferably calculated with msecs_to_jiffies() or  usecs_to_jiffies(), to make the code largely HZ-invariant.

```c
long wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout (struct completion \* x, unsigned long timeout);
```

where, **`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

**`timeout`** – timeout value in jiffies

It returns **-ERESTARTSYS** if interrupted, **0** if timed out, positive (at least 1, or a number of jiffies left till timeout) if completed.

#### **wait_for_completion_killable**

This waits to be signaled for completion of a specific task. It can be interrupted by a kill signal.

```c
int wait_for_completion_killable (struct completion \* x);
```

where, **`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

It returns **-ERESTARTSYS** if interrupted, **0** if completed.

#### **wait_for_completion_killable_timeout**

This waits for either completion of a specific task to be signaled or for a  specified timeout to expire. It can be interrupted by a kill signal. The timeout is in jiffies. Timeouts are preferably calculated with  msecs_to_jiffies() or usecs_to_jiffies(), to make the code largely  HZ-invariant.

```c
long wait_for_completion_killable_timeout (struct completion \* x, unsigned long timeout);
```

where, **`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

**`timeout`** – timeout value in jiffies

It returns **-ERESTARTSYS** if interrupted, **0** if timed out, positive (at least 1, or a number of jiffies left till timeout) if completed.

#### **try_wait_for_completion**

This function will not put the thread on the wait queue but rather returns  false if it would need to en queue (block) the thread, else it consumes  one posted completion and returns true.

```c
bool try_wait_for_completion (struct completion \* x);
```

where,**` x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

It returns **0** if completion is not available **1** if a got it succeeded.

This **`try_wait_for_completion()`** is safe to be called in IRQ or atomic context.

### Waking Up Task

#### **complete**

This will wake up a single thread waiting on this completion. Threads will  be awakened in the same order in which they were queued.

```c
void complete (struct completion \* x);
```

where, **`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

**Example:**

```c
complete(&data_read_done);
```

#### **complete_all**

This will wake up all threads waiting on this particular completion event.

```c
void complete_all (struct completion \* x);
```

where, **`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

### Check the status

#### **completion_done**

This is the test to see if completion has any waiters.

```c
bool completion_done (struct completion \* x);
```

where, **`x`** – holds the state of this particular completion

It returns 0 if there are waiters (**`wait_for_completion`** in progress) **1** if there are no waiters.

This **`completion_done()`** is safe to be called in IRQ or atomic context.

## Timer

### Introduction

*What is a timer in general?* According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timer), A timer is a specialized type of clock used for measuring specific time intervals. Timers can be categorized into two main types. A timer that  counts upwards from zero for measuring elapsed time is often called a  stopwatch, while a device that counts down from a specified time  interval is more usually called a timer.

## Timer in Linux Kernel

In Linux, the kernel keeps track of the flow of time by means of timer  interrupts. These timer interrupts are generated at regular timer  intervals by using the system’s timing hardware. Every time a timer  interrupt occurs, the value of an internal kernel counter is  incremented. The counter is initialized to 0 at the system boot, so it  represents the number of clock ticks since the last boot.

## Uses of Kernel Timers

- Polling a device by checking its state at regular intervals when the hardware can’t fire interrupts.
- The user wants to send some messages to another device at regular intervals.
- Send an error when some action didn’t happen in a particular time period.
- Etc.

## Kernel Timer API

Linux Kernel provides the driver to create timers that are not periodic by default, register the timers and delete the timers.

We need to include the **`<linux/timer.h>`** (**`#include <linux/timer.h>`**) in order to use kernel timers. Kernel timers are described by the timer_list structure, defined in **`<linux/timer.h>`**:

```c
struct timer_list {
    /* ... */
    unsigned long expires;
    void (*function)(unsigned long);
    unsigned long data;
};
```

The **`expires`** field contains the expiration time of the timer (in jiffies).
On expiration, **`function()`** will be called with the given **`data`** value.

### Initialize / Setup Kernel Timer

There are multiple ways to Initialize / Setup Kernel Timer. We’ll see one by one.

#### init_timer

```c
void fastcall init_timer ( struct timer_list \* timer);
```

This function is used to initialize the timer. **`init_timer`** must be done to a timer prior to calling any of the other timer functions.  If you are using this function to initialize the timer, then you need to set the callback **`function`** and **`data`** of the **`timer_list`** structure manually.

**Argument:**

**`timer`** – the timer to be initialized

#### setup_timer

```c
void setup_timer(timer, function, data);
```

Instead of initializing the timer manually by calling **`init_timer`**, you can use this function to set **`data`** and **`function`** of **`timer_list`** structure and initialize the timer. *This is recommended to use*. This API will be available for the older kernel version. If you are  using the newer kernel, then you have to use the below API (**`timer_setup`**).

**Argument:**

**`timer`** – the timer to be initialized

**`function`** – Callback function to be called when the timer expires. In this callback function, the argument will be **`unsigned long`**.

**`data`** – data has to be given to the callback function

##### Example

```c
/* setup your timer to call my_timer_callback */
setup_timer(&my_timer, timer_callback, 0);
//Timer Callback function. This will be called when timer expires
void timer_callback(unsigned long data)
{

}
```

#### timer_setup

If you use a newer kernel version, then setup_timer won’t work. So you need to use this **`timer_setup`** function.

```c
void timer_setup(timer, function, data);
```

Instead of initializing the timer manually by calling **`init_timer`**, you can use this function to set **`data`** and **`function`** of **`timer_list`** structure and initialize the timer. *This is recommended to use*.

**Argument:**

**`timer`** – the timer to be initialized

**`function`** – Callback function to be called when the timer expires. In this callback function, the argument will be **`struct timer_list \*`**.

**`data`** – data has to be given to the callback function

##### Example

```c
/* setup your timer to call my_timer_callback */
timer_setup(&my_timer, timer_callback, 0);
//Timer Callback function. This will be called when timer expires
void timer_callback(struct timer_list * data)
{
}
```

#### DEFINE_TIMER

```c
DEFINE_TIMER(_name, _function, _expires, _data)
```

If we are using this method, then no need to create the **`timer_list`** structure on our side. The kernel will create the structure in the name of **`_name`** and initialize it.

**Argument:**

**`_name`** – name of the timer_list structure to be created

**`_function`** – Callback function to be called when the timer expires

**`_expires`** – the expiration time of the timer (in jiffies)

**`_data`** – data has to be given to the callback function

### Start a Kernel Timer

#### add_timer

```c
void add_timer(struct timer_list \*timer);
```

This will start a timer.

**Argument:**

**`timer`** – the timer needs to be started

### Modifying Kernel Timer’s timeout

#### mod_timer

```c
int mod_timer(struct timer_list \* timer, unsigned long expires);
```

This function is used to modify a timer’s timeout. This is a more efficient way to update the **`expires`** field of an active timer (if the timer is inactive it will be activated).

**`mod_timer(timer, expires)`** is equivalent to:

**`del_timer(timer);`**

**`timer->expires = expires;`**

**`add_timer(timer);`**

**Argument:**

**`timer`** – the timer needs to modify the timer period

**`expires`** – the updated expiration time of the timer (in jiffies)

**Return:**

The function returns whether it has modified a pending timer or not.

0 – **`mod_timer`** of an inactive timer

1 – **`mod_timer`** of an active timer

### Stop a Kernel Timer

The below functions will be used to deactivate the kernel timers.

#### del_timer

```c
int del_timer(struct timer_list \* timer);
```

This will deactivate a timer. This works on both active and inactive timers.

**`timer`** – the timer needs to be deactivated

**Return:**

The function returns whether it has deactivated a pending timer or not.

0 – **`del_timer`** of an inactive timer

1 – **`del_timer`** of an active timer

#### del_timer_sync

```c
int del_timer_sync(struct timer_list \* timer);
```

This will deactivate a timer and wait for the handler to finish. This works on both active and inactive timers.

**Argument:**

**`timer`** – the timer needs to be deactivated

**Return:**

The function returns whether it has deactivated a pending timer or not.

0 – **`del_timer_syncof`** an inactive timer

1 – **`del_timer_sync`** of an active timer

**Note:** *callers must prevent restarting of the timer, otherwise this function is  meaningless. It must not be called from interrupt contexts. The caller  must not hold locks that would prevent the completion of the timer’s  handler. The timer’s handler must not call add_timer_on. Upon exit, the  timer is not queued and the handler is not running on any CPU.*

### Check Kernel Timer status

#### timer_pending

```c
int timer_pending(const struct timer_list \* timer);
```

This will tell whether a given timer is currently pending, or not. Callers  must ensure serialization wrt. other operations done to this timer, eg.  interrupt contexts or other CPUs on SMP.

**Argument:**

**`timer`** – the timer needs to check the status

**Return:**

The function returns whether the timer is pending or not.

0 – **`timer`** is not pending

1 – **`timer`** is pending
