A C program contains the following declaration
char *color[6] = {“red”, “green”, “blue”, “white”, “black”, “yellow”};

● What is the meaning of color?
    ->array of char type having 6 characters

● What is the meaning of (color+2);
    ->this gives the character in the 3rd place i.e; blue

● What is the value of *color?
    ->this points to the 1st element of the array i.e; red

● What is the value of *(color+2)?
    ->this gives the character in the 3rd place i.e; blue

● How do color[5] and *(color + 5) differ?.
    ->color[5] directly accesses the sixth element of the color array, which is a pointer to the string "yellow". 
      On the other hand, *(color + 5) is equivalent and also points to the string "yellow".
      The notation *(color + 5) is a pointer arithmetic representation, and color[5] is the array subscript notation, 
      but they refer to the same memory location.
