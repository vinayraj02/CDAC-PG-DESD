A C program contains the following declaration
float table[2][3] = { { 1.1,1.2,1.3},{2.1,2.2,2.3}};

● What is the meaning of a table?
    ->table is a 2-dimensional array in C, representing a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns,
        where each element is of type float.

● What is the meaning of (table+1)?
    ->This represents a pointer arithmetic operation. 
        It points to the memory location of the second row of the array.

● What is the meaning of *(table+1)?
    ->Dereferencing the pointer (table+1) gives the second row of the array.    

● What is the meaning of (*(table+1)+1)?
    ->This adds 1 to the value pointed to by the pointer (table+1). In other words, 
    it accesses the second element of the second row.

● What is the meaning of (*(table)+1)?
    ->Dereferencing the pointer table gives the first row of the array. 
    Adding 1 to this gives the second element of the first row.

● What is the value of *(*(table+1) +1)?
      ->This gives the value at the second element of the second row of the array.

● What is the value of *(*(table)+1)?
    ->This gives the value at the second element of the first row of the array.

● What is the value of *(*(table+1))?
    ->This gives the value at the first element of the second row of the array.

● What is the value of *(*(table) + 1)+1?
    ->This gives the value at the second element of the first row of the array, and then adds 1 to it.

In summary:

table: 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns.
(table+1): Pointer to the second row.
*(table+1): Second row.
(*(table+1)+1): Value at the second element of the second row.
(*(table)+1): Value at the second element of the first row.
*(*(table+1)+1): Value at the second element of the second row.
*(*(table)+1): Value at the second element of the first row.
*(*(table+1)): Value at the first element of the second row.
*(*(table)+1) + 1: Value at the second element of the first row plus 1.
